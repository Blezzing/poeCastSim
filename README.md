# poeCastSim
A simple simulator to check how many continous casts of a skill can be done in Path of Exile with some setup.

# Execution
Arguments are given at program start, execute it once without arguments to get help.

# Todo
It worked for my reservation greedy occultist, but for other setups it could need more features:
* Mana on hit configurations
* Mana leech configurations
